In DevOps, Python’s built-in modules like `os`, `subprocess`, `json`, and `csv` are extremely useful for day-to-day automation.

For example, with the **`os` module**, we can manage environment variables such as credentials, API keys, or database connection strings, and also handle file and directory operations like rotating logs or creating deployment folders.

The **`subprocess` module** is great for integrating Python with command-line tools. For instance, I can run commands like `kubectl get pods`, `terraform apply`, or `docker build` directly from a Python script, which is very handy when automating CI/CD pipelines.

With the **`json` module**, we can parse structured data. A common use case is reading API responses from cloud providers like AWS or Kubernetes, or working with Terraform outputs in JSON format.

And finally, the **`csv` module** is useful when we want to process monitoring data exported from systems like CloudWatch or Prometheus, or generate deployment and test reports in tabular form.

So overall, these modules help DevOps engineers automate tasks like environment setup, deployments, API integrations, and reporting—all without needing external dependencies.
