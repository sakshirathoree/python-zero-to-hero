**Answer:**
Python is a great choice for DevOps because of several key factors.

First, its **readability and simplicity** make it very approachable. The syntax is clean and close to plain English, which means even team members who aren’t full-time developers can quickly understand and maintain scripts if they’re written with good structure and naming conventions.

Second, Python has a **rich standard library** with built-in modules like `os`, `subprocess`, `json`, and `csv` that are very useful for common automation tasks. Beyond that, the **Python Package Index (PyPI)** offers thousands of third-party libraries—such as `boto3` for AWS, `requests` for APIs, and `pytest` for testing—that extend its capabilities and make it especially powerful in a DevOps context.

Another advantage is **cross-platform support**. Python scripts can run consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows, which is very valuable when working in diverse environments.

Python also works well as **“glue code”**, easily integrating with APIs, command-line tools, and even other languages—making it ideal for automation and orchestration tasks.

Finally, Python has a **large, active community**. That means there’s a wealth of tutorials, forums, and pre-built solutions available, which makes solving problems and implementing best practices much faster.

So overall, Python’s readability, strong library ecosystem, portability, integration capability, and community support make it one of the most effective languages for DevOps tasks.
